How to Avoid Getting Banned for Using a Wallhack in Rainbow Six Siege
 
While the wallhacks we have recommended are undetected by the game's anti-cheat system, there is still a risk of getting banned for using them. This might happen if you are reported by other players, if you use an outdated or detected wallhack, or if you abuse the wallhack too much. Here are some tips on how to avoid getting banned for using a wallhack in Rainbow Six Siege:

- Use the wallhack sparingly and discreetly. Don't make it obvious that you are using a wallhack by constantly pre-firing, wall-banging, or tracking enemies through walls. Try to act natural and play smart.
- Don't brag or boast about using a wallhack in chat or voice communication. This will only draw attention and suspicion from other players and might get you reported.
- Don't use the wallhack in ranked or competitive matches. This will not only ruin the game for others, but also put you at a higher risk of getting banned. Stick to casual or custom matches instead.
- Keep your wallhack updated and check for new versions regularly. The developers of the wallhacks are constantly working to keep them undetected and compatible with the game updates. However, sometimes they might miss something or take some time to update their wallhacks. Make sure you always use the latest version of the wallhack and check for updates before using it.
- Delete or disable your wallhack when you are not using it. Don't leave it running in the background or keep it in your game folder. This might cause problems or detection if you forget about it or if someone else uses your computer.
